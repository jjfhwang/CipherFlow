# CipherFlow

## Description

CipherFlow is a framework designed to facilitate the development, backtesting, and deployment of automated cryptocurrency trading strategies. Built with Rust for performance and reliability, CipherFlow provides a robust foundation for quantitative trading. The framework is integrated with Python to leverage its rich ecosystem of data science and machine learning libraries for strategy development and analysis. CipherFlow streamlines the entire trading lifecycle, from initial strategy conception to live market execution. It aims to empower traders and developers to build sophisticated trading systems with ease and confidence.

## Features

*   **High-Performance Backtesting Engine:** A Rust-based backtesting engine allows for rapid and accurate evaluation of trading strategies against historical market data. This enables rigorous strategy validation before deployment.

*   **Python Integration:** Seamless integration with Python allows users to define and analyze trading strategies using popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. This provides a flexible and powerful environment for strategy development.

*   **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** CipherFlow supports real-time data feeds from various cryptocurrency exchanges, providing up-to-the-minute market information for live trading.

*   **Automated Order Execution:** The framework automates the process of placing and managing orders on cryptocurrency exchanges, based on the defined trading strategy.

*   **Risk Management Tools:** Built-in risk management tools help users define and enforce risk parameters, such as position sizing and stop-loss orders, to protect their capital.

## Installation

1.  **Install Rust:** Ensure you have Rust installed. You can download and install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). After installation, verify that Cargo (Rust's package manager) is available by running `cargo --version`.

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the CipherFlow repository from GitHub:
    `git clone [repository_url]`
    `cd CipherFlow`

3.  **Install Rust Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and use Cargo to build the project and install dependencies:
    `cargo build`

4.  **Install Python Dependencies:** CipherFlow utilizes Python for strategy definition and analysis. We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    `python3 -m venv venv`
    `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)

    Install the required Python packages using pip:
    `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn python-dotenv` (add any other python dependencies here)

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:** CipherFlow relies on environment variables for configuration, such as API keys for cryptocurrency exchanges. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables:
    
    Ensure the `python-dotenv` package is installed to load these variables in your Python scripts.
