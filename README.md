# CipherFlow

## Description

CipherFlow is a Rust library designed to streamline and simplify the implementation of various cryptographic algorithms and protocols. It aims to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly interface for developers to integrate robust cryptography into their applications. CipherFlow prioritizes safety and performance through Rust's memory management and concurrency features, offering a reliable foundation for building secure systems. The library is designed to be modular, allowing users to select and utilize only the necessary cryptographic components, minimizing dependencies and improving overall application size. It provides implementations of common symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, hashing functions, and key derivation functions.

## Features

*   **Symmetric Encryption:** Offers implementations of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with various key sizes and modes of operation (CBC, CTR, GCM), providing secure and efficient data encryption and decryption.
*   **Asymmetric Encryption:** Includes RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC (Elliptic-Curve Cryptography) implementations for secure key exchange and digital signatures, facilitating secure communication and authentication.
*   **Hashing Algorithms:** Provides support for SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 hashing algorithms for data integrity verification and password storage.
*   **Key Derivation Functions (KDFs):** Implements PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) and Argon2 for securely deriving cryptographic keys from passwords, mitigating the risk of brute-force attacks.
*   **Modular Design:** Enables developers to select and use only the required cryptographic algorithms, reducing dependencies and improving application size and performance.

## Installation

To install CipherFlow, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) installed on your system. If you don't have them already, you can download them from the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can add CipherFlow as a dependency to your project by adding the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file under the `[dependencies]` section:



After adding the dependency, run the following command in your project directory to download and build the crate:



This will download CipherFlow and all its dependencies, and compile them into your project.

## Usage

Here are a few examples of how to use CipherFlow in your Rust code:

**AES Encryption and Decryption:**
